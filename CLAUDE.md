# CLAUDE.md — Project Rules for KodaCars Website

## Design Rules

- Never use a black background (`bg-koda-black`) for sections. Use Koda purple (`bg-koda-purple` / `#6423bd`) for dark sections, matching the homepage.
- The primary brand purple is `koda-purple` / `koda-blue` (`#6423bd`). The darker hover variant is `koda-darkblue` (`#501c97`).

## Terminology

- Always write "near-airport" (hyphenated) instead of "airport" when referring to the parking vertical. For example: "near-airport parking", not "airport parking".
